EVENT BASED
Actions that start when an event happens and resolve
  1. immediately
  2. when they are 'done'
  3. when another event happens

When we take into acount conditions that read the 'state' of the game, things get much more complex

Everything is the same class
Camera, Controls are all on the class object, not based on the hero object
... In the future I want everything to be able to be controlled. We need data for that. 

Front end fills in the blanks of every object and hero based on the default model. The question is - is this on a phaser level? Probably not, its probably on the redux store level

The back end only stores whatâ€™s different than the default model and will delete any null key -> value pairs given to it

Never send an update with more data than you need
