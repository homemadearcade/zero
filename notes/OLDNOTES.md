ARCADE VS MATTER
  - Matter can do rotational collisions. Shit gets hit and spins around and stuff
  - Arcade can NOT rotate
  - Arcade can check easily where a collision occured - upleftrightdown
  - Static entityInstance in matter can only move position, not via velocity or thrust or force
  - Arcade has immovable vs pushable. These are two different concepts

  Have to decide what to do... would suck to have to do two interfaces for everything. Unless we limited it to just what Arcade Physics can do...What can arcade physics do that matter physics toggle that matter physics cant?

  Does having 'path system' do anything? Does that resolve movement?

  What sort of games will come out of Matter JS, what sort of games will come out of Arcade? What are the real design strengths?
  What sort of gameplays? What sort of stories, What sort of world is this?

  POSSIBLE MATTER ADDITIONS

  Set Initial Velocity
  Rope
  'shoot'
  Create Force ( like a bomb type thing )
