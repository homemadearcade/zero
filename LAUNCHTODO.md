NOW
  A system that checks for ALL connections and reconnect if needed
  codrawing stroke ACKnowledged return... and...If that isnt being ackowledge let them know they have disconnected. The host can never disconnect. The host is truth. But also its true that the host not accepting updates is a PROBLEM that needs to be fixed. If they arent getting the update, they need to also reset the connection

  Know where a connection is initiated ( right now game connection is iniated where?? in the lobby? make this more explicit) and then you check for disconnection, if its not updating correctly, disconnect it yourself and then reconnect
