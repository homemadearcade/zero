TEXTURE STROKE HISTORY
  Load stroke history when you boot up a codrawing image, then allow local strokes when its loaded

  Try to save stroke history ALL of the time actually, after every stroke..maybe. you can remove check before browser closes

  Saving the image REPLACES the stroke history. For security - both should be done at the same time

WRAPPING UP
  Another Lobby View - Arcade View. We send them to the main page inside of an iframe or just a game list?. MAKE THIS A CREDITS VIEW

  TOOL TIP sort of thing.  We need to be able to HIGHLIGHT a div or UNLOCKABLE
