  COBROWSING PUBLISHER CHECK if its connected to the client? why is that? Theres some problem right ! COBROWSING_UPDATE_ACKNOWLEDGED? Perhaps...

  TextureStrokeHistory model 
    Load stroke history when you boot up a codrawing image, then allow local strokes when its loaded

    Try to save stroke history ALL of the time actually, after every stroke..maybe. you can remove check before browser closes

    Saving the image REPLACES the stroke history. For security - both should be done at the same time
