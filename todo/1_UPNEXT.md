UPLOAD PHOTOS
  Textures
    Security for changing the game textures.... Any user can really edit those textures now because amazon isnt checking. Perhaps it has to go through our check?
    attempt the user profile pic upload first
    Should be a /texture route not an aws route
  Agora User Video, have it load a user and have it like upload it as a profile pic??

VIDEO CALL BLOCKING
  End Call for everyone in lobby, End call for self
  Mute and cut user video should be an object. I think theres both, admin muting someone in side a lobby. Kick out of experience, etc. Mute someone at an experience level. Also a user can mute someone if they dont like them
