TAGS
  Implement/TRANSFORM the Relation editor into a tags system. Without breaking changes
  Each class has its own tag automatically

// Should tags be part of a global database?
// Will tags defeat the purpose of class type
    // Class type seems to really just be for the sake of the UI anyways
  Do Players and Zones need to truly be seperated? Beyond UI?
