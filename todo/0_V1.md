UPGRADES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LobbyView Improvements
  I think the lobby should just be a layer on top of the activity...
  The WithCobrowsing, With Lobby, With Video Stuff, withMultiplayer game session should not be duplicated the way it is now

MODALS
  Create Brush/Class -> Edit Sprite -> ( Create Brush -> Edit Sprite )...
    Perhaps make Sprite Editor a root level modal?
  Make add Color Not a Modal?
  Make Codrwaing an activity basically and have the codrawing modal be an Iframe into the Codrawing Activity. Allow codrawing activities to be created on the fly

REMOVE .type === from any GAME LOGIC, Class.type is PURELY FOR UI
  swap all the objects to correct game layers when it changes so we can use the layers correctly for visibility and for taking pictures...

Cobrowsing -> Cogaming

Have Player Camera Area be a Zone

SECURITY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

security for redux state stuff. Since cobrowsers can edit the redux state, they could potentially change the users redux state for their user, their password for example, and then they could try to get them to save their account and save that new password.

security for codrawing and cobrowsing, make sure they are in the lobby!

Security for textures

Boot users from lobby. Ban users. Bannable offences. Require Phone number verification once banned. If Banned again needs to go through some .. system

Starts off where you have to apply to be a creator
