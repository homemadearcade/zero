COBROWSING even for admins. EVERYONE REGISTERS COBROWSING. A whole chain of cobrowsing can occur

MODALS
  Create Brush/Class -> Edit Sprite -> ( Create Brush -> Edit Sprite )...
    Perhaps make Sprite Editor a root level modal?
  Make add Color Not a Modal?
  Make Codrwaing an activity basically and have the codrawing modal be an Iframe into the Codrawing Activity. Allow codrawing activities to be created on the fly
  Aggregate Color flow should manage whether or not you add new color or select from the aggregate colors. Add Color is highest order Modal. Aggregate Color Select is lower order. This should be standard
The way we can do it I think is with more constants
  You have basically method prepared outside of the react component that can dispatch what the component needs. they are all tied via a CONSTANT lookup that is set whenthe modal opens. All this other modal crap could also be done
Similar to the way I did the priority for UserVideo
Actually I think it may be possible to do with react portal. Just base don the order in the dom.

SECURITY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

security for redux state stuff. Since cobrowsers can edit the redux state, they could potentially change the users redux state for their user, their password for example, and then they could try to get them to save their account and save that new password.

security for codrawing and cobrowsing, make sure they are in the lobby!

Boot users from lobby. Ban users. Bannable offences. Require Phone number verification once banned. If Banned again needs to go through some .. system

Starts off where you have to apply to be a creator
