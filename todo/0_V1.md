UPGRADES

COBROWSING even for admins. EVERYONE REGISTERS COBROWSING. A whole chain of cobrowsing can occur

DIALOGS
  Create Brush/Entity -> Edit Sprite -> ( Create Brush -> Edit Sprite )...
    Perhaps make Sprite Editor a root level dialog?
  Make add Color Not a Dialog?
  Make Codrwaing an activity basically and have the codrawing dialog be an Iframe into the Codrawing Activity. Allow codrawing activities to be created on the fly
  Aggregate Color flow should manage whether or not you add new color or select from the aggregate colors. Add Color is highest order Dialog. Aggregate Color Select is lower order. This should be standard
The way we can do it I think is with more constants
  You have basically method prepared outside of the react component that can dispatch what the component needs. they are all tied via a CONSTANT lookup that is set whenthe dialog opens. All this other dialog crap could also be done
Similar to the way I did the priority for UserVideo
Actually I think it may be possible to do with react portal. Just base don the order in the dom.

STEPS UPGRADE
  and also it would really cool if it could really understand previous steps and what to do to match context menu
  STEP SECTIONS
    So tehy arent as long. Be able to add a step break in

SECURITY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--

security for redux state stuff. Since cobrowsers can edit the redux state, they could potentially change the users redux state for their user, their password for example, and then they could try to get them to save their account and save that new password.

security for codrawing and cobrowsing, make sure they are in the lobby!

Boot users from lobby. Ban users. Bannable offences. Require Phone number verification once banned. If Banned again needs to go through some .. system

Starts off where you have to apply to be a creator

SHORT URLS
  implement short Ids into the urls and other things. So like the game room url is like /game/1234 and the lobby url is like /lobby/1234. And so like... we dont use .id anymore unless we are doing a mongo edit. For lookup/mapping we can do short ids

.id -> ___mongoId. Finish my id cleanup
