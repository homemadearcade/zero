COBROWSING even for admins. EVERYONE REGISTERS COBROWSING. A whole chain of cobrowsing can occur

Better lobby instance ui... Basically you the drawer should of course be tab-based but you should be able to open starting with any tab
 the tabs

  Chat room?

DIALOGS
  Create Brush/Entity -> Edit Sprite -> ( Create Brush -> Edit Sprite )...
    Perhaps make Sprite Editor a root level dialog?
  Make add Color Not a Dialog?
  Make Codrwaing an activity basically and have the codrawing dialog be an Iframe into the Codrawing Activity. Allow codrawing activitys to be created on the fly
  Aggregate Color flow should manage whether or not you add new color or select from the aggregate colors. Add Color is highest order Dialog. Aggregate Color Select is lower order. This should be standard
The way we can do it I think is with more constants
  You have basically method prepared outside of the react component that can dispatch what the component needs. they are all tied via a CONSTANT lookup that is set whenthe dialog opens. All this other dialog crap could also be done
Similar to the way I did the priority for UserVideo
Actually I think it may be possible to do with react portal. Just base don the order in the dom.

DATA
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTING/COPYING/SYSTEM
  get original entity id so that things inherit
  I have to decide what Ids mean and I have to decide fast
  Copying, importing, etc how tf do I do it!

  When you copy a class. It should open edit Graphics with IsNew triggered

  IMPORTED GAMES
    Mark an imported game as just like a 'library' in order to be able to import it. I just cant trust users to handle this on their own. 

    It seems to be easiest all around for importing from system or from library that we COPY everything. but I think thats not REALLY true for this. WE want INTEROPABLE game in the future... INTEROPABLE so like a version of a tag with the same name in one game shouldnt be different than another version of a tag

    Problem is that... We want a lot of classes baked into the game data 

  remove system data

BETTER DATA MODEL
  Decide - what does default mean, what does initial mean?
    Initial Data vs Default data...?
    Initial Data initializes
    Default data fallsback
    I think its actually lower case TagModel, EntityModel, RelationModel, EffectModel, EventModel
  Put this on BACK END, not front end? Not sure, think about this. It will cause arcade games to break

Default Data is ALL The Data
Augemented data on top of Model data for a specific purpose
Model is the data REQUIRED for the UI to function

Redo autogeneration, system data, effects, autogeneratios. Theres gotta be a better way

-

  We would need the game to keep track of important ids in ITS MODEL - Player Tag, Spawn Zone Tag, etc. but some things we dont want copied across games. Those things can perhaps stay?

  GAME DIALOG
    Important Ids ( Once System and Autogeneration Data is changed.. )

RESIZING EASY

Sizing like the way unity does it. Entities would have arrrows attached to them on the left, right, bottom, top and you can resize from there

Stop its physics while its being resized

SECURITY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--

security for redux state stuff. Since cobrowsers can edit the redux state, they could potentially change the users redux state for their user, their password for example, and then they could try to get them to save their account and save that new password.

security for codrawing and cobrowsing, make sure they are in the lobby!

Boot users from lobby. Ban users. Bannable offences. Require Phone number verification once banned. If Banned again needs to go through some .. system

SHORT URLS
  implement short Ids into the urls and other things. So like the game room url is like /game/1234 and the lobby url is like /lobby/1234. And so like... we dont use .id anymore unless we are doing a mongo edit. For lookup/mapping we can do short ids

.id -> ___mongoId. Finish my id cleanup
