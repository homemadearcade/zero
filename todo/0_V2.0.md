BETTER DATA MODEL
  Decide - what does default mean, what does initial mean?
    Initial Data vs Default data...?
    Initial Data initializes
    Default data fallsback
  Put this on BACK END, not front end? Not sure, think about this. It will cause arcade games to break

Default Data is ALL The Data so that you dont miss a single property,
StartingData is the augmented data on top of default

Makes Tags/Classes/Textures be able to be shared by all

EXPERIENCES V2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Roles, Privacy Settings, Multiplayer, More Activities

Experience has Roles
  Roles can be invited to activities and lobbys with certain privelages

Lobbys has an inviteList
Lobbys can be public, tickets only, invite only, or friends only

ACTIVITIES
  Lobby Door, AcitivityDoor 
  Drawing Activity
  Seperate Lobby and Activities
    Each user can have its own different activity it is viewing
    Activities have their own instructions
  A Drawing and a Game have various privacy settings - Room Members Only, Approved Users, Owner Only
  DoorAcitivity (lobby or activity) is a way out of the Lobby that participants can self select, it must have one or more LobbyIds attached to it 

That means I can make one room Game Owner only privacy settings. and then I can move to another room thats Room Members Only. and it can be edited by everyone... OMG? So likE EVERYONE could make a game like The Hotel. EVeryone can make their own collaboritive game making system lmao.... yes. ITs true. EVeryone could make their own homemade arcade

IN-WORLD CHARACTER EDITING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GAME POWERS
  inPlaythrough mode you can check the class of a player interface Ids and those ids are what are allowed to be shown. ! So then we can have game powers :)

  Limit the amount of clasees that can be made by your character. Or perhaps they cost resources or take time

  For example - Yes, you can create a class, but how much does it cost to create? Can this information be on a class? Like is a spell.. a..Class? Like you can place it on the map? Or perhaps the spell is to like switch Heros

  How much does it cost to PLACE the instance? Costs for placing instances vs creating classes

  Inventory system?

GROUPS/TAGSv2
  Key, Door, Player, Powerup, Some sort of system that allows features to build ontop of eachother using the relationship menu. Cuz right now since relationship menu is almost excuslively class based... I cant make anything specific beforehand. Fire, Organic, Enemy ETC. This can eventually be conbined with the Sprite Descriptors system :). So then I can build a general relationship between two tags. Or is it all tag based... :0?

  Yes and this is what allows the simulation things to begin and how to allow characters to move across worlds. Yes classes are good but what about tags

  Ok and so like sure .. Across world tags that can relate to eachother. Wooden, Stone, Metal, Fire, Water, 

  And like you can of course make your own items willy nilly that are SUPER powerful.

  You can make any of your own substance, but nothing compares to the core substance this earth is made of. 

  With the system substances, the core elements, whatever. Those have limits to how they can be used, you CAN make your own sustances if you want, but those are NOT AS COOL. Maybe the creation of your own substances costs core substances?

GRID BASED GAME
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MAPS VS GAMES
  Maps are for World Simulations, Strategy Games, Overworlds
  Games are for Real Time Gameplay, Platformers, Physics
  I think all of the current scenes/entities/drawings should be placed into... their own folder?
  HOW TO SUPPORT TWO DIFFERENT PHYSICS SYSTEMS? At the root level with Sprite? or... another way?

GameRoomLocal
  isArcadeGame vs IsMapGame?
    isEditor?
      MapEditorScene?
      MapScene
      ArcadeEditorScene
      ArcadeScene?
    Or is Editor a component of the scenes. Scenes have members..?

MULTIPLAYER GAMES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PLAYER -> GAME INSTANCE SYSTEM
  gameInstanceId system. If your not the host, you ASK to join, you dont just JOIN. you are given player id/gameInstance Id by the host

  Player should be just another object instance. Also add a variable called like 'controlling instance' which is like a copy or something? think on this. Too many variations between player and object
