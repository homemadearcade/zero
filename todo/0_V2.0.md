WORLD TAGS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GROUPS/TAGSv2
  More tags, make tags global
  Across world tags that can relate to eachother. Wooden, Stone, Metal, Fire, Water, 
  And like you can of course make your own items willy nilly that are SUPER powerful.
  You can make any of your own substance, but nothing compares to the core substance this earth is made of. 
  With the system substances, the core elements, whatever. Those have limits to how they can be used, you CAN make your own sustances if you want, but those are NOT AS COOL. Maybe the creation of your own substances costs core substances?
  For SCENARIOS, tags need to be VERY standardized across worlds
  And you can like make also RELATIONSHIPS global. Relationships that are... connected to your tag. You can only decide how your own tag is effected by other peoples tags in the world. The tags will be strangely named. Like 'Brians Wood" vs "Hectors Wood". But these substances will be defined by the worlds of these users, what they interact with, etc. A lot of tags will become very popular!

GRID BASED GAME
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MAPS VS GAMES
  Maps are for World Simulations, Strategy Games, Overworlds
  Games are for Real Time Gameplay, Platformers, Physics
  HOW TO SUPPORT TWO DIFFERENT PHYSICS SYSTEMS? At the root level with Sprite? or... another way? YEs I think basicall you keep everything but the playground layer
  I think you need a different Editing Scene definitely..?

GameRoomLocal
  isArcadeGame vs IsMapGame?
    isEditor?
      MapEditorScene?
      MapScene
      ArcadeEditorScene
      ArcadeScene?
    Or is Editor a component of the scenes. Scenes have members..?

MULTIPLAYER GAMES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PLAYER -> GAME INSTANCE SYSTEM
  gameInstanceId system. If your not the host, you ASK to join, you dont just JOIN. you are given player id/gameInstance Id by the host

  Player should be just another object instance. Also add a variable called like 'controlling instance' which is like a copy or something? think on this. Too many variations between player and object
