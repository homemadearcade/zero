EDIT CLASS MODAL
  All Edit Entity stuff in same place
  Dialogues
  Behavior -> Side Editor Stuff
  TABS FOR the EDIT CLASS MODAL ( yes : )  
    AUTOGENERATION FORM
  CLEAN UP UI in general
  NEW UI
    Add the Edit _, Edit _ underneath the Hover Preview when an object is selected, maybe also give that a border

  What is up with these...Borders for the cobrowsing open tool. It seems as if Layers have a border around them, classes do not, and also only effects and events have around it in abstract menu?
