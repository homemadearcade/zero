Lobby Animations?

Instead of confetti, throw their sprites out like that
more hover state across everything

Also like use the BACKGROUND BACKGROUND as like an animation space where we give sorts of feedback. Color, animations, sprites show up there? Not sure. MAKE IT FEEL GOOD. JUICY. What the admin is hovering over? Get what you are hovering over?

Most recently used. Just have a > chevron right to open the entire set of classes, brushes, colors, etc. Every time a brush or color is selected, set a lastUsedDate on it and sort by that :). Actually its like 
  > Brush 
    BG
    PG
    FG
  > Game Objects 
    Characters
      > Instances
    Objects
      > Instances
    Zones
      > Instances
    Lights
      > Instances
  > Other(?)
    Dialogue
    Stages
    Cutscenes
    Relations
    Images
  ? Idk

Its all floating action buttons? Theres recently used brushes, recently used classes, then theres recently edited ( stages, dialogues ) I guess thats baiscally what we have? Hmm not sure...yeah maybe all those things are sorted by recently used... and then PLUS is outside of that scope as a FAB. And then The last item in the grids is like Open Modal for More which gives you a grid modal view of infinite items
