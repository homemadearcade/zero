BETTER CONNECTION CHECKS
  After you saved an image, your playground stopped updating. Was codrawing just disconnected?

  Client hits reset but the host didnt get it so they are off track. It must have missed a game room update ( try resetting connection on an interval? ) 

  I think that Errors should just simualte a refresh of almost essnetially the entire page ( except the video call ? ). 

  If theres a problem with cobrowsing connection there could easily be a problem with lobby, game instance, etc.

GAME INSTANCE NETWORKING MODEL FIX
  Instance info about each stage. POSITION/ROTATION is not in this list
  This list updates, deletions, entityModelId, if spawned or not. maybe even IS PLAYER

  Is this on the game room?? I think it is! gameInstanceState or perhaps just gameState

  fixex - Sometimes when switching to a game room when the host isnt logged on yet and then trying to load it again later leads to all sorts of bugs of it not loading

  fixes - When booting up a cobrowsing scene the TRANSFORMED player id isn’t…. Booting right away

  fixes - Same with objects that are deleted!  It creates them all and then forgets to delete one that are deleted

  fixes ( maybe ) - If the host is not online, codrawing strokes will not save! Most importantly if you are non the same SCENE as the host it will not save
