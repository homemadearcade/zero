WHEN STROKING
  Texture id on canvas that is undefined?? 

IN EXPERIENCE
  When we switched the color of an entity, it didnt have the instance data, spawnX of undefined

TEXTURE ID WHEN GOING THROUGH STEPS??
  .textureId is not defined on the Codrawing Canvas anymore? - in lobbies. Maybe cuz someone aint the host
  Must be because of draw player 

Space bar is getting captured on the accordions
