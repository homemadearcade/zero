If you switch roles the camera breaks 

When I switched participant with admin things got messed up when trying to join

Changing Game host requires you to reload the game doesnt it. Because host is decided in PreloaderScene

Change Stages was broken 

Just have a thing that prevents it from spawning near the edge?
Wtf is up with this spawning bs?? Why the corner??

Add Player defaults are broken in EntityAdd

Switching between games is broken now at least in games page
