Users can start by making a world that has many experiences inside of it.
Experiences can take place on the map!

Tag system is extensively used in order to allow cross-world things working

Its my OWN rules to start off before you can make your own world with its own rules. First you can just join my world with its own rules

The Portal from Digital -> Physical will be later and the rules of the universe will have to be rewritten
