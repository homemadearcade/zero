Basically its possible that we break homemade arcade up into multiple parts

The intro
The friend
The enemy

and you can take a game into any of them, you can start with any of the experiences

Features needed would be lobbys would just need to pick between 2/3 experiences

We need to allow the user to see what experiences they have bought a ticket for and seleect whcih game they would like to use for that experience
