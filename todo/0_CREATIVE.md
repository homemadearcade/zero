PARTICIPANT STEP BUILDER
 - A whole timer interface like at the bottom like an editor?
  It would be awesome to also be able to have a timer for the properties of an object. Where u can morph their property over time.

  Yes this is basically the steps model. I need to... Think a bit about how to integrate this into UI 

  But basically... If I can keep track of every action that occurs. Like EVERY ACTION. Specifically game effects that the editor does such as spawning - resizing... the INSTANCE effects are what are missing

  Record experience effects and add to step??
