Randomizations  
  Create a new randomization!
    Dynamic vs Static
    Is it randomized each time the game is loaded? or once while editing?
      you can delete all instances created from the randomiziton anytime
      Map based, density, total items, etc
  I think its called ( Spawn Group )
    And yeah I think maybe you make a spawn group first before you can call 'spawn'
    Player View should be a zone, Another zone option for the 'Whole game'
  and then it also becomes 'Spawn Instance' once you run it

Jump, Movement, Collisions, Projectile property librarys
  or Perhaps just add it to the interface system that already exists? Add a property object to it?

TOUR component for admins? There this 'tour component' I found when searching ui libraries, its dope!

AUDIO EFFECTS :)

LOOK @ TWEENS?

TIMER SYSTEM
 - A whole timer interface like at the bottom like an editor?
  It would be awesome to also be able to have a timer for the properties of an object. Where u can morph their property over time.
