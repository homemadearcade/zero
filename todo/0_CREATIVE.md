TIMER SYSTEM
 - A whole timer interface like at the bottom like an editor?
  It would be awesome to also be able to have a timer for the properties of an object. Where u can morph their property over time.

  LOOK @ TWEENS?

Voice to TExt? NLP Tab? Create 2 X with 8 layers, etc, eetc

TOUR component for admins? There this 'tour component' I found when searching ui libraries, its dope!

AUDIO EFFECTS :)

KEYBOARD MODE FOR GAME?

KEYBOARD MODE FOR STEPS

Step Creation
  Record Steps, 
  Use game for effects.. Like go from Entity to create Step instead of starting with making a step. Choose entity and its effect FIRST
