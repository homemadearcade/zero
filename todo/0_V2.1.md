In v2.1 Players within Visions become characters that persist across experiences, lobbys, games, etc and have can a home within a simulated world that is always running

WORLD, SCENARIOS, INTERFACE POWERS, ADVENTURE MODE

-------------------------------

IN_GAMEWORLD EDITING
GAME POWERS
  inPlaythrough mode you can check the class of a player interface Ids and those ids are what are allowed to be shown. ! So then we can have game powers :)

  Limit the amount of clasees that can be made by your character. Or perhaps they cost resources or take time

  For example - Yes, you can create a class, but how much does it cost to create? Can this information be on a class? Like is a spell.. a..Entity? Like you can place it on the map? Or perhaps the spell is to like switch Heros

  How much does it cost to PLACE the instance? Costs for placing instances vs creating entityModels

  Inventory system?


MAPS VS GAMES VS WORLDS
  Worlds exit and are running at all times
  Maps are already created and dont run until this experience starts, they look a lot like world
  Games are different than maps and worlds

New Activity
Scenario. Takes place in a world that already exists and modifies that world

Scenarios are edited inside worlds...

Perhaps scenarios have a world attached when they are created
