In v2.1 Players within Visions become characters that persist across experiences, lobbys, games, etc and have can a home within a simulated world that is always running

MAPS VS GAMES VS WORLDS
  Worlds exit and are running at all times
  Maps are already created and dont run until this experience starts, they look a lot like world
  Games are different than maps and worlds

New Activity
Scenario. Takes place in a world that already exists and modifies that world

Scenarios are edited inside worlds...

Perhaps scenarios have a world attached when they are created
