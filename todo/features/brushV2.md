CODRAWING BUG UPDATES
  WHEN STROKING
    Texture id on canvas that is undefined?? 
    
  TEXTURE ID WHEN GOING THROUGH STEPS??
    .textureId is not defined on the Codrawing Canvas anymore? - in lobbies. Maybe cuz someone aint the host
    Must be because of draw player 

  SECURITY
    ALSO security is still a problem. If I send in a texture id I want to replace then I CAN. Maybe canvas images determine their own permissions instead of arcades...
    So its like yes you gotta be in da lobby but also you gotta be allowed to edit the canvas image

BRUSHES V2, LAYERS V2
  Honestly it seems the brush and color system kinda sucks. 
  we need a new system, perhaps call it paintbrush system. The way layers are recognized in the data is very strange. Like why? A color is a color and a brush is a brush? why dont the layers store its colors and brushes instead??

  Spray Can, Paintbrush, Crayon?

  For paintbrush, use opacity, have it slowly layer on itself, square or circle paintbrush. Thats what pencil is. Or perhaps its like you can change the opacity of any brush, also you can change whether its circle or square
