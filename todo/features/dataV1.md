Interface Group Ids?? Interface Ids??
Gotta clean all that SHT UP
Should the model container IIDs be GROUP Ids?
Unlock tabs....

Clean up Effect Data. How the fuck are these effect icons, textures found?

Autogeneration seperated into parts

-

All Data should be cloned. No merged, imported data. No!
Better clone deep when applying default player? Default jumper?

Do one piece of data at a time. Start with brushes or something?

-

We would need the game to keep track of important ids in ITS MODEL - Player Tag, Spawn Zone Tag, etc. but some things we dont want copied across games. Those things can perhaps stay?

GAME DIALOG
  Important Ids ( Once System and Autogeneration Data is changed.. )

-

Make importing a game library REALLY REALLY WORK and REALLY REALLY SMOOTH

--

IMPORTING/COPYING/SYSTEM
  get original entity id so that things inherit
  I have to decide what Ids mean and I have to decide fast
  Copying, importing, etc how tf do I do it!

  When you copy a class. It should open edit Graphics with IsNew triggered

  IMPORTED GAMES
    Mark an imported game as just like a 'library' in order to be able to import it. I just cant trust users to handle this on their own. 

    It seems to be easiest all around for importing from system or from library that we COPY everything. but I think thats not REALLY true for this. WE want INTEROPABLE game in the future... INTEROPABLE so like a version of a tag with the same name in one game shouldnt be different than another version of a tag

    Problem is that... We want a lot of classes baked into the game data

SELECT FORMS
  Also For Select Relation Tag. Switch between visibility for Tag Interface Id vs Data Source
  For Select Entity, Switch between Data Source vs Entity Interface Id
