Destroyed By Message ( You lost because... )

MORE EVENTS
  onCutsceneEnd Event, onStageEntered
  On touch end. Instead of an array - plant a boolean on another collider? maybe? and like reset that boolean every loop. Once it doesnt need to be reset, thats when the touch stopped? right?

Better 404 page

MUTE/CUT VIDEO
  Mute and cut user video should be an object. I think theres both, admin muting someone in side a lobby. Kick out of experience, etc. Mute someone at an experience level. Also a user can mute someone if they dont like them
  This should be the start of ON_LOBBY_INSTANCE_EVENT. Like the confetti....Also remove that confetti and use the ts particle version

Remote Editors are all also zones too?

SELECT FORMS
  For items that are unable to be selected ( perhaps because they ARE NOT ALLOWED TO BE SELECTED ) tell the user why
