TEXTURE STROKE HISTORY
  Load stroke history when you boot up a codrawing image, then allow local strokes when its loaded

  Try to save stroke history ALL of the time actually, after every stroke..maybe. you can remove check before browser closes

  Saving the image REPLACES the stroke history. For security - both should be done at the same time

  Security for changing the game textures.... Any user can really edit those textures now because amazon isnt checking. Perhaps it has to go through our check?

  Should be a arcadeGame route not an aws route, attempt the user profile pic upload first

BIG MOUSE SELECTOR CHANGE

Most recently used. Just have a > chevron right to open the entire set of classes, brushes, colors, etc. Every time a brush or color is selected, set a lastUsedDate on it and sort by that :). Actually its like 
  > Brush 
    BG
    PG
    FG
  > Game Objects 
    Characters
      > Instances
    Objects
      > Instances
    Zones
      > Instances
    Lights
      > Instances
  > Other(?)
    Dialogue
    Stages
    Cutscenes
    Relations
    Images
  ? Idk

Its all floating action buttons? Theres recently used brushes, recently used classes, then theres recently edited ( stages, dialogues ) I guess thats baiscally what we have? Hmm not sure...yeah maybe all those things are sorted by recently used... and then PLUS is outside of that scope as a FAB. And then The last item in the grids is like Open Modal for More which gives you a grid modal view of infinite items

LOBBY UPDATE
  Can we change where the power buttons, etc are? Disable star button instead of hide it? Same with the save button..
