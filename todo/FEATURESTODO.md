TEXTURE STROKE HISTORY
  Load stroke history when you boot up a codrawing image, then allow local strokes when its loaded

  Try to save stroke history ALL of the time actually, after every stroke..maybe. you can remove check before browser closes

  Saving the image REPLACES the stroke history. For security - both should be done at the same time

  Security for changing the game textures.... Any user can really edit those textures now because amazon isnt checking. Perhaps it has to go through our check?

  Should be a arcadeGame route not an aws route, attempt the user profile pic upload first

TOWERS
  Enemy Projectiles.. Towers. Different kinds of Towers... Area Effect
  Some that face you
  yes very smart, very very smart
  Select Class for Follow Movement 

MODALS
  Fix how modals work...Youve got ALL THESE MODALS STACKED ON TOP OF EACHOTHER IN game Editor. Sometimes we want to open a modal on top of another, how can we let this happen? We need to be able to open Cutscene maker, and class maker inside of another modal ( mainly from the relations menu )

INFO BOX
  Right Click/Left Click Action. Infomration about the thing you are hovering on. What else?
  Or.. a stage type thing. That shows what you are currently highlighting over

  Theres a stage and then theres tabs underneath
  Tabs are. Brush, Class, Game
