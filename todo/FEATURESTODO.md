TEXTURE STROKE HISTORY
  Security for changing the game textures.... Any user can really edit those textures now because amazon isnt checking. Perhaps it has to go through our check?
  attempt the user profile pic upload first
  Should be a /texture route not an aws route
  
COMPENDIUM BOX
  Goomba
  Flying Goomba
  Tower
  Octorok
  Hammer Bros

MODALS
  Remove these root level modals and put into a list somewhere
    Relations -> Create Relation,
    Cutscene -> Create Cutscene, 
    Stages -> Create Stages
  Hide both of these modals when snapshot editor is open
    Game Metadata -> My Images

Can Phaser just register keys without taking them over??
