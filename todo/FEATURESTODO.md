TEXTURE STROKE HISTORY
  Load stroke history when you boot up a codrawing image, then allow local strokes when its loaded

  Try to save stroke history ALL of the time actually, after every stroke..maybe. you can remove check before browser closes

  Saving the image REPLACES the stroke history. For security - both should be done at the same time

  Security for changing the game textures.... Any user can really edit those textures now because amazon isnt checking. Perhaps it has to go through our check?

  Should be a arcadeGame route not an aws route, attempt the user profile pic upload first

  Save BG PG FG to the aws images object

TOWERS
  Enemy Projectiles.. Towers. Different kinds of Towers... Area Effect
