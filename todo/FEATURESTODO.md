UPLOAD PHOTOS
  Textures
    Security for changing the game textures.... Any user can really edit those textures now because amazon isnt checking. Perhaps it has to go through our check?
    attempt the user profile pic upload first
    Should be a /texture route not an aws route
  Agora User Video, have it load a user and have it like upload it as a profile pic??

LIBRARY
  Be able to open class library classes from some sort of class bucket thing. Start with context menu?
  When creating a class?, when selecting a class? From context menu?

GROUPS/TAGS
  Key, Door, Player, Powerup, Some sort of system that allows features to build ontop of eachother using the relationship menu. Cuz right now since relationship menu is almost excuslively class based... I cant make anything specific beforehand. Fire, Organic, Enemy ETC. This can eventually be conbined with the Sprite Descriptors system :). So then I can build a general relationship between two tags. Or is it all tag based... :0?

  Yes and this is what allows the simulation things to begin and how to allow characters to move across worlds. Yes classes are good but what about tags

  Ok and so like sure .. Across world tags that can relate to eachother. Wooden, Stone, Metal, Fire, Water, 

  And like you can of course make your own items willy nilly that are SUPER powerful.

  You can make any of your own substance, but nothing compares to the core substance this earth is made of. 

  With the system substances, the core elements, whatever. Those have limits to how they can be used, you CAN make your own sustances if you want, but those are NOT AS COOL. Maybe the creation of your own substances costs core substances?
