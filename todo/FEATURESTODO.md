TEXTURE STROKE HISTORY
  Load stroke history when you boot up a codrawing image, then allow local strokes when its loaded

  Try to save stroke history ALL of the time actually, after every stroke..maybe. you can remove check before browser closes

  Saving the image REPLACES the stroke history. For security - both should be done at the same time

  Security for changing the game textures.... Any user can really edit those textures now because amazon isnt checking. Perhaps it has to go through our check?

  Should be a arcadeGame route not an aws route, attempt the user profile pic upload first

INFO BOX
  Right Click, Left Click, Name of Class
  You should be able to ^ highlight for the cobrowsing user any thing that is an INFOBOX
  TOOL TIP sort of thing.  We need to be able to HIGHLIGHT a div or UNLOCKABLE

  ALSO What you currently have selected with your mouse, and perhaps the current game state, and title of game?
