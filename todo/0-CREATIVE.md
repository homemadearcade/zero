IN-WORLD CHARACTER EDITING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GAME POWERS
  inPlaythrough mode you can check the class of a player interface Ids and those ids are what are allowed to be shown. ! So then we can have game powers :)

  Limit the amount of clasees that can be made by your character. Or perhaps they cost resources or take time

  For example - Yes, you can create a class, but how much does it cost to create? Can this information be on a class? Like is a spell.. a..Class? Like you can place it on the map? Or perhaps the spell is to like switch Heros

  How much does it cost to PLACE the instance? Costs for placing instances vs creating classes

GROUPS/TAGSv2
  Key, Door, Player, Powerup, Some sort of system that allows features to build ontop of eachother using the relationship menu. Cuz right now since relationship menu is almost excuslively class based... I cant make anything specific beforehand. Fire, Organic, Enemy ETC. This can eventually be conbined with the Sprite Descriptors system :). So then I can build a general relationship between two tags. Or is it all tag based... :0?

  Yes and this is what allows the simulation things to begin and how to allow characters to move across worlds. Yes classes are good but what about tags

  Ok and so like sure .. Across world tags that can relate to eachother. Wooden, Stone, Metal, Fire, Water, 

  And like you can of course make your own items willy nilly that are SUPER powerful.

  You can make any of your own substance, but nothing compares to the core substance this earth is made of. 

  With the system substances, the core elements, whatever. Those have limits to how they can be used, you CAN make your own sustances if you want, but those are NOT AS COOL. Maybe the creation of your own substances costs core substances?

TIMER SYSTEM
 - A whole timer interface like at the bottom like an editor?
  It would be awesome to also be able to have a timer for the properties of an object. Where u can morph their property over time.
