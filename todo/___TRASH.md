useHooks for Unlockable Data and other data... yes actually thats needed isnt it. Because right now like unlockable stuff gets a state.unlockableIntefrfaceIds thing at the bottom

Game Model class? for like getting data from redux so we can get game data with functions
For all these util functions, I need to rethink how utils are done, is there objects we can use? should I turn gameModel, user, lobby, etc all these things into entityModels? Is that normal inside of redux? should it really be all functional. Where IS THE STATE? What state belongs in my entityModels and what state belongs in REDUX. React UI = Redux. Phaser UI = OOP
^^^
I think so yes. Basically we can... turn Game Model into a class that has the Scene on it.. yes :)
