COBROWSING BORDERS
  What is up with these...Borders for the cobrowsing open tool. It seems as if Layers have a border around them, classes do not, and also only effects and events have around it in abstract menu?

EDIT ENTITY_MODEL DIALOG
  All Edit Entity stuff in same place
  Dialogues
  Behavior -> Side Editor Stuff
  TABS FOR the EDIT ENTITY_MODEL DIALOG ( yes : )  
    AUTOGENERATION FORM
  CLEAN UP UI in general
  NEW UI
    Add the Edit _, Edit _ underneath the Hover Preview when an object is selected, maybe also give that a border

CREDITS VIEW
  Add the other arcade games below theirs
  Credits Links are broken 

HOVER PREVIEW
  Layer on the top right
  Color name on bottom
  Tags
  for Relations - show the full Relation view in the preview - Only show event in the list?

Better Keyboard UI 
  What keys can I press during cobrowsing? what does esc do right now?

HoverPreview should not dissapear during map actions it should actually tell you what you need to do on the map

STEPS PREVIEW UI
  So like when a step is completed or like an effect occurs, we might want a snackbar?? or a log?

  There should be a steps preview when you arent in the control booth. And like the option to go to the next step
