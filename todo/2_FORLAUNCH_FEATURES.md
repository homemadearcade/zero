ENTITY INSTANCE UPGRADE
  Compound Static Body for Entities

DALL E GENERATOR

Wiggle An Object Or highlight When its hovered over - WHY NOT!
Highlight on the map
https://www.react-spring.dev/examples wiggle when you import class, when class is added, etc


Live Editor Update, Perhaps Behaviors tab whole situation
  Like maybe do you create a behavior in the live editor and then you can like add it to the entityModel???

  the game Model would have... collisionsBehaviors, movementBehaviors

  Also MAYBE remove directional behavior... and gotta make something very static version of the advanced directional cuz directional dont work for and gravity sht

  Also like a sims-like system for choosing the number. Number selection is never good.the sliders suck. A lot of effects need numbers. Camera Shake, Gravity Pull/Push
