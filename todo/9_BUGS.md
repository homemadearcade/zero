BUGS
When the game is stopped, it doesnt change relations ( when editing them ) until the next reload?

IF KEY ISSUES PERSIST
set Interval for keyboard capture issue?
Can Phaser just register keys without taking them over??

BETTER REDIRECT ( cuz its broken sometimes )
  So for the redirect its possible we can just pass it as a prop to the 'login' component and the 'register' component. As well as have the 'onREgisterClick' button be a prop

Fix with Cobrowsing?? right now broken af when switching between two different users

if theres no player spawn zone it leads to the camrea not being destroyed thing? so thats a way to reproduce the bug FYI
