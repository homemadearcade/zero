We need to continue to make our own experiences to include all the features needed by the engine before handing it off to other artits

We also need to understand what other artists would want to be able to do with this engine before we can move onto a public release

We need to understand how to make it simpler and more intuitive as well

The only data updates needed are for MEDIA.... NOTHING ELSE

BETTER BRUSHES
  Honestly it seems the brush and color system kinda sucks. 
  we need a new system, perhaps call it paintbrush system. The way layers are recognized in the data is very strange. Like why? A color is a color and a brush is a brush? why dont the layers store its colors and brushes instead??

  Spray Can, Paintbrush, Crayon?

  For paintbrush, use opacity, have it slowly layer on itself, square or circle paintbrush. Thats what pencil is. Or perhaps its like you can change the opacity of any brush, also you can change whether its circle or square

  Upload/Design your own brush!

  Even smaller brush size for Background, Foreground layers

NEW ADD SYSTEM
  Plus Button in the bottom right corner for adding things, and ALSO a context specficic plus button ( dont remove the ones that exist I mean! )
