--------------------
INTERFACE IDS
  Generate interfaceIds based on the game model. 

  Then...generate action ids for the game model based off the interfaceIds 

  ( also generate interface ids for interface action ids ... )?

  Add effects to the game model for each of the actions and interfaceIds..

  Then have the experience model generate experienceEffects based on the effects of the game model 

  interfaceIds[userId] === their default interfaceId... for us to use?

  Interface Ids should not have on click

  UIUX ISSUE
    What is up with these...Borders for the cobrowsing open tool. It seems as if Layers have a border around them, classes do not, and also only effects and events have around it in abstract menu?
