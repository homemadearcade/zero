LIBRARY
  Easy system for saving library entityModels and relations
  Boot all that into the game!

  Sends to Stars To Collide
  Sends to Stars on Interact
  Game Over on __
  Win Game on __

STEPS UPDATE
  Prompts, Next Steps...
  A bit more automated is needed..
  Skippable option in a step
  Collapsible steps??
  Buttons just ‘Cue the next segment’ so the button is based on the title of the next section
  Player in editing game starts off invisible so we can make it invisible after BG color select
  Spawn bar inside the Spawn bar when you have selected gravity

If the instructions could be smart and understand if the requirements of their context has been and have a checkmark if it is, and a check mark if it isnt, and also it would really cool if it could really understand previous steps and what to do to match context menu

COMBINE experienceModel with experience

INTERFACE IDS
  Generate interfaceIds based on the game model
  Interface Ids themselves may have to be auto generated, for dynamic lookup
  Default unlocked interface ids need to be not shown in the unlockables tree
  I think maybe the game room manages loading interface ids and what not? or do games do that? WHO manages that? why when a game is loaded? troubling. Its hard to manage both at the same time... You need both states

  What is up with these...Borders for the cobrowsing open tool. It seems as if Layers have a border around them, classes do not, and also only effects and events have around it in abstract menu?
