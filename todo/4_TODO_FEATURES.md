LIVE EDITOR UPGRADE
  Behaviors tab?

  Like maybe do you create a behavior in the live editor and then you can like add it to the entityModel???

  the game Model would have... collisionsBehaviors, movementBehaviors

  Also MAYBE remove directional behavior... and gotta make something very static version of the advanced directional cuz directional dont work for and gravity sht

  Also like a sims-like system for choosing the number. Number selection is never good.the sliders suck. A lot of effects need numbers. Camera Shake, Gravity Pull/Push

AUDIO EFFECTS

PARTICLE EFFECT ON INSTANCES WHEN YOU CHANGE A ENTITY_MODEL
  Explode on Destroy Tag

EFFECTS
  Speed Boost Relationship
  Remove Tag, Add Tag Effect

Layers are like ALL collision layers except they only collide with objects that have the layer checkbox selected. Collision Menu has a list of all Collideble Layers
