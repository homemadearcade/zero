LIBRARY
  Turn library on and off ( both in Selects and in the ClassList )
  Easy system for saving library entityClasses and relations
  Be able to open class library entityClasses from some sort of class bucket thing. Start with context menu?
  When creating a class?, when selecting a class? From context menu?

STEPS UPDATE
  Prompts, Next Steps...
  A bit more automated is needed..
  Skippable option in a step
  Collapsible steps??
  Buttons just ‘Cue the next segment’ so the button is based on the title of the next section
  Player in editing game starts off invisible so we can make it invisible after BG color select
  Spawn bar inside the Spawn bar when you have selected gravity
  
If the instructions could be smart and understand if the requirements of their context has been and have a checkmark if it is, and a check mark if it isnt, and also it would really cool if it could really understand previous steps and what to do to match context menu
