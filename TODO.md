CONVERSATION

Considering only allowing buttons for Density
  Light Heavy qualities
  Do the same for other physics things?

What sort of STEPS to use?

Check if switching game lobbies works

Is this the right dimensions? node size 12, total size 1200. Think about how we switch to a larger world in the future. How many sections of the world do we want?

Do we have little sections that fold and unfold in the columns?
  Brush Options
  Background
  Playground
  Overhead

  Hero
  Objects
  etc

TODO NEXT

Reset Button
Pause Button
Stop Game

CONTROLS - speed, other phaser examples, etc
CAMERA
GAME BOUNDARY

DRAWING
  Tinting
  Pixel Pencil, Brush, Spray Can
  Unlock snap to grid?
  BUG - Sometimes a Playground sprite is not picked up because it doesnt have alpha in the center
  BUG - brushing a ton sucks because the new image comes in and overwrites what you have
  Sync network drawing?

TODO LATER

Theres two problems with cobrowsing to think about
1) When we are checking something about the user, such as if they are admin or not. Do we check local or remote user
2) When clicking on a button while cobrowsing, how do we dispatch the remote event?

Cobrowsing Click event

Popup for connection errors

Better error handling in cobrowsing

Unauthenticate socket when logging out

Finish everything and just add more and more behaviors, and controls, and customization

then perhaps find the right way to do custom coding - collision, events? paths? etc

BEHAVIORS

Remove top layer

Soccerball ( attach to hero on collide and allow hero to shoot out again )

--------

TODO TIME PERMITTING

Mobile

Blockchain NFT editing thing

TAB + for moving through the UI
