Thoughts - where should the camera be during a run through???

TODO

NOW

Think about preloader scene?
should it actually be like the overaching scene controller?
The thing is once a new scene starts..., the old instance will lose all its information
I think it all needs to be on redux? or a larger object?
yes.. I think redux..State needs to be shared as well

Also switch games? whats going on here? At least set it up so it can work in the future. Give scenes ids. Give an initial scene Id to the main data set

STATUS TOOLBAR
  The time? If you have an object selected its obvious?
