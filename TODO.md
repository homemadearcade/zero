CONVERSATION

We gotta make some choices on canvas size, grids, painting possibilities

Right now the canvas is 1000 x 1000 which is pretty good size

For LAYERS - Do we want them to be able to draw whatever they want? What level of detail?
For Layer0 the collision layer - How does that convert into collision grids? How finite is our collision grids? Pixel by Pixel collision?? I wonder

TODO NEXT

implement my own physics properties - speed, controls, jump, dash etc
camera and game boundary work

Cobrowing using redux state connect thing.
Basically just check if cobrowsing user or not, if there is a cobrowsing user then swap the editor, video, etc state for the cobrowsing remote state

CORE OBJECT -> ACTIVE OBJECT

--------

TODO LATER

Cobrowsing Click event

Popup for connection errors

Better error handling in cobrowsing

Unauthenticate socket when logging out

Perhaps use something called withLobby so that I can have different url states during onboard and for the game. And you can use back button to go to the lobby 

also withAgoraVideo?

Finish everything and just add more and more behaviors, and controls, and customization

then perhaps find the right way to do custom coding - collision, events? paths? etc

BEHAVIORS

Remove top layer

Soccerball ( attach to hero on collide and allow hero to shoot out again )

--------

TODO TIME PERMITTING

Mobile

Blockchain NFT editing thing
