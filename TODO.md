UI
  The sliders - you dont really know what zero is
  UI system for changing ui based on ArcadeGame vs Simulation VS PapaBearGame...
  UI COLOR needs and ...If you have a white background, if you have a grey background, Still issues!! Two border colors instead of ui color change
  When trying to name a class, spacebar doesnt work
    Shift + Press it works fine
  When a class is highlighted, you should be able to see all of them highlighted on the map?
  You should be able to hide games, you should be able to hide classes, hide lobby not delete them, hide users, dont delete them
  Add New Cutscene inside of Create Relation? Add a new Class inside of Create Relation
  Auto hide live editor when using keys?

BUGS
  Performance huge upgrade - sort all instances into class Id. Use for relations

FLOW
  Spawn object at the edge of the heros camera?
  Class is selected after being created, Movement is prompted after placing the first object?
