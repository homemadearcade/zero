Camera Drag vs WASD vs Arrow Keys. Controls conversation

Lobby Steps

Zoom Slider

What does Unlockable really look like? Weve got question mark squares. So what options to we want? What about options we actually just straight up want to hide? 

So all this cobrowsing click together crap, does it all work the way we want it to?

Transparency? Should it be handled by brush or by color?
