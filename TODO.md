Move relations to top level game
  player should be just another object instance. Also add a variable called like 'controlling instance' which is like a copy or something? think on this. Too many variations between player and object

  Need to be able to select instances ( such as 'this' or 'that' )

  Effect 'Player'? Like is a player an actual class???? Like interface Ids and everything? idk. Can you swap players.. ? - This also relates to global relations, like how do you say 'this' or select an instance id? Its tough.. I THINK this has to do with creating generalized ids for all things
