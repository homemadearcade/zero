TODO CHORES 

VALIDATION ON ALL FORMS
DATA VALIDATIN FOR CLASSES, BRUSHES, ETC

Context menu X,Y being sent back and forth to the cobrowsers is not correct x, y. You need to send %

Outline Class ( for eraser and objectInstance, and camerapreview? )

this.isHost this.isLocal should I save? should I cobrowse, should I send remote updates?? All this lower level variables that are also coming from the top down

Seperate more reducers?

Game Modal class? for like getting data from redux  so we can get game data with functions

So for the redirect its possible we can just pass it as a prop to the 'login' component and the 'register' component. As well as have the 'onREgisterClick' button be a prop

--------

TODO FEATURES ( MAYBE )

Zoom Slider

For all these util functions, I need to rethink how utils are done, is there objects we can use? should I turn gameModel, user, lobby, etc all these things into classes? Is that normal inside of redux? should it really be all functional. Where IS THE STATE? What state belongs in my classes and what state belongs in REDUX. React UI = Redux. Phaser UI = OOP

interfaceUnlock other features, such as camera move with keys? drag object? etc

Unlock snap to grid?

Lock to cobrowsers camera

Right click -> snap camera to section? regardless if you are in section or not?

circle for objectInstance body?
