CONVERSATION TOPICS

Camera Drag vs WASD vs Arrow Keys. Controls conversation

Edit Mode, how does that work. Can you control the hero? What else changes? Can you still add items during non edit mode?

Lobby Steps

Zoom Slider

What does Unlockable really look like? Weve got question mark squares. So what options to we want? What about options we actually just straight up want to hide? 

So all this cobrowsing click together crap, does it all work the way we want it to?
