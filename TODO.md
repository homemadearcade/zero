TODO

Cobrowsing Click event

Popup for connection errors

Better error handling in cobrowsing

Unauthenticate socket when logging out

Perhaps use something called withLobby so that I can have different url states during onboard and for the game. And you can use back button to go to the lobby 

also with AgoraVideo?

put all errors into a popup where I can clear them and return to the view
