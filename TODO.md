TODO

Basic static objects please, basic paintbrush v1?....
and also maybe just squares with colors please

implement my own physics properties - speed, controls, jump, dash etc
camera and game boundary work

Cobrowing using redux state connect thing.
Basically just check if cobrowsing user or not, if there is a cobrowsing user then swap the editor, video, etc state for the cobrowsing remote state

--

Cobrowsing Click event

Popup for connection errors

Better error handling in cobrowsing

Unauthenticate socket when logging out

Perhaps use something called withLobby so that I can have different url states during onboard and for the game. And you can use back button to go to the lobby 

also withAgoraVideo?

ANSWERS
Everything is the same class
Camera, Controls are all on the class object, not based on the hero object
... In the future I want everything to be able to be controlled. We need data for that. 

Finish everything and just add more and more behaviors, and controls, and customization

then perhaps find the right way to do custom coding - collision, events? paths? etc
