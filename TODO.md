Where is video? More thought needs to happen

Cobrowsing Click event

Basic phaser stuff

Popup for connection errors

Better error handling in cobrowsing

Unauthenticate socket when logging out

Perhaps use something called withLobby so that I can have different url states during onboard and for the game. And you can use back button to go to the lobby 

#THOUGHTS

How does the game update? Is it FLUX? one way updates?

Whats the different between the game model and the game instance? How do those play out?

How does a user join a game?

How are inputs handled for a game?

How is the game view brought up from the lobby? is it still in the lobby?
