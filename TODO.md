Copy game when homemade arcade is completed and put it in a different database

INFO BOX - Right Click, Left Click, Name of Class
Game Name Area, Stage Name Area
   Cutscenes, Stages, Metadata, OThers? More 
Think on toolbars
  Stages, Cutscenes, Relations, Images, Metadata, Boundaries
I think perhaps you can switch one of these bars between class/brush and stage information
  Play Cutscne, Switch to Stage

  UI COLOR needs and ...If you have a white background, if you have a grey background, Still issues!! Two border colors instead of ui color change
  When trying to name a class, spacebar doesnt work
    Shift + Press it works fine
