CONVERSATION

Considering only allowing buttons for Density
  Light Heavy qualities
  Do the same for other physics things?

What sort of STEPS to use?

Do we have little sections that fold and unfold in the columns?
  Brush Options
  Background
  Play Area
  Overhead

  Hero
  Objects
  etc

--

TODO NEXT

Eraser
Reset Button
Pause Button
Stop Game
Exit Game

CONTROLS - speed, other phaser examples, etc
CAMERA
GAME BOUNDARY

DRAWING
  Tinting
  Stamp?, Brush, Pencil, Spray Can, Eraser
  Unlock snap to grid?
  BUG - Sometimes a play area sprite is not picked up because it doesnt have alpha in the center
  BUG - brushing a ton sucks because the new image comes in and overwrites what you have
  Sync network drawing?

--------

TODO LATER


Theres two problems with cobrowsing to think about
1) When we are checking something about the user, such as if they are admin or not. Do we check local or remote user
2) When clicking on a button while cobrowsing, how do we dispatch the remote event?

Cobrowsing Click event

Popup for connection errors

Better error handling in cobrowsing

Unauthenticate socket when logging out

Perhaps use something called withLobby so that I can have different url states during onboard and for the game. And you can use back button to go to the lobby 

also withAgoraVideo?

Finish everything and just add more and more behaviors, and controls, and customization

then perhaps find the right way to do custom coding - collision, events? paths? etc

BEHAVIORS

Remove top layer

Soccerball ( attach to hero on collide and allow hero to shoot out again )

--------

TODO TIME PERMITTING

Mobile

Blockchain NFT editing thing

TAB + for moving through the UI
