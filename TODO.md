Theres two problems with cobrowsing to think about
1) When we are checking something about the user, such as if they are admin or not. Do we check local or remote user
2) When clicking on a button while cobrowsing, how do we dispatch the remote event?

Cobrowsing Click event, cobrowsing scroll

Better error handling locally and with cobrowsing, perhaps have just one error array and make sure that array is shared in cobrowsing as well

Unauthenticate socket when logging out
